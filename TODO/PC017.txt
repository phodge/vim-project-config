PC017 work out what handlers we need and document them PRIORITY

- do we need a "project unload" handler?
- should we have handlers based on autocmd event names, or something more
  general that we can be flexible with in the future?
- can we please come up with some user stories / common scenarios and document
  them as examples because that is the whole point of this plugin
- work out whether the plugin *actually* needs to be loaded ahead of all others
  as per README notice?
