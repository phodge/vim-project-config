PC009: add caching for reading configs

I propose two layers of caching
- have a global in-memory cache of projectid -> configloc
  - do always re-read the cfg each time to ensure still valid
    - "each time" means once per major operation
  - XXX: its probably actually OK to NOT reread the cfg each time and just have
    the cache invalidated by autocmds
- have a per-operation cache so that we don't compile the list of configloc more
  than once per operation, and don't read each cfg more than once per operation
- eventually - have a global in-memory cache of path -> configloc to ensure
  opening configs via path is also snappy
