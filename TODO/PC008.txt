PC008 optimised dispatching for project config

It seems there are two approaches:

A) set up all autocmds on plugin initial load, then each autocmd always looks
for project hooks to call

B) the autocmds are created on an as-needed basis only for the buffers that
need them (as specifically as possible), once on startup, and then again each
time the project-config file(s) are written.

Advantage of (A):
- simple to implement

Advantages of (B):
- don't have to read/process so many files on each autocmd (even if you have no
  project configs using a particular hook, we'd still burn CPU cycles looking
  for them for approach (A))
