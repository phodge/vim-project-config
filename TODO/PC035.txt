PC035 improved projectroot/projectid caching

Current caching implementation suffers from the following drawbacks:
- doesn't persist after quitting vim, so you need to run the expensive `git
  rev-list --max-parents=0 HEAD` on every neovim startup
- cache doesn't invalidate when #initalise() is re-run
- cache doesn't invalidate when project.vim files are modified
- cache just ... doesn't invalidate
- need to have a manual mechanism to invalidate the cache
- need to have some unit tests and/or E2E tests for caching
- cache path doesn't make sense for vim
- cache path can't be customised
- a bad cache file needs to be deleted
- cache items need an expiry time
