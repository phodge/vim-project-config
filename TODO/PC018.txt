PC018: document what we do with "config state" when reloading PRIORITY

- just allow the project.vim functions to dump anything into self?
- how do we "reserve" names so that we can add new hooks in the future without conficts?
- if we're providing a different value for 'self' then how can users implement
  private helper functions within their project.vim scripts?
